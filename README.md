"# NSD-PoN" 
Naruto Shippuden Dattebayo - Path of Ninja

Game built using Dream Maker, a tool from Byond, an ancient game building software.
This is being kept here and something I'll, one day (TM), come back to and deliver, even if in a different technology.

It's possible to run this by downloading [Byond](https://www.byond.com/) and running the game.

One day... who knows when though.
